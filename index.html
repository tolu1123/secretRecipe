                        CHICKEN IMMORTAL</h4>

                        <li>
                            <h6>STEP 1</h6>
                            <p>Take the Chicken laps/thighs and cut the undesirable parts(The Chicken feet) away.
                                Then rinse the Chicken laps in water.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>STEP 2</h6>
                            <p>Put a pot on a lighted stove with about 2 litres of water. Then put the rinsed Chicken laps in the pot.
                                Then add sliced garlic, sliced onions, seasoning, salt, thyme and curry in the pot. Allow the contents
                                of the pot to boil for about 25minutes.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>STEP 3</h6>
                            <p>Once the cooking of the Chicken is done, put a large frying on the lighted stove, then pour the Vegetable-Oil 
                                in the frying pan and allow to heat up. Once the Oil is heated up, carefully put the Chicken laps in the 
                                heated oil to prevent spilling. Then allow to fry in the Oil till the coat of the Chicken meat becomes golden brown.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>STEP 4</h6>
                            <p>Once the frying is done. Spread the Suya pepper in a large bowl, slice some onions, mix both the pepper and the 
                                onions in the bowl. After you have done this, sprinkle the mixed pepper and onions on the meat till it becomes coated.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>STEP 5</h6>
                            <p>You can now serve the CHICKEN IMMORTAL with any drink of your choice.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>Once you are done with the meal. Remember to close all the windows to prevent word from getting
                                to your neigbours that you are about to take a meal that makes you experience the feeling of mortal immortality.
